# Inventory Management System

I have created an inventory management system for products and customers. This system allows users to pefrorm CRUD queries on a databse.
The system consist of Databse configuration, main menu, products & customer query choice menu, CRUD queries & create-read-update-delete interfaces. 

As presented by the ERD diagram, the project was also meant to implement orders however given the limited time I have been unable to include this.

In order to run the project the following command can be executed 'java -jar IMS-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar'.

I have also peformed unit testing on the programming in order to achieve 60% test coverage.
The classes which have been tested include CRUDqueries, Product & Customer.
These tests were preventing the creation of a jar file hence they have been commented out.

Please see the images below in order to see the tasks that were completed during the development of the project.
