Inventory Management System

I have created an inventory management system on eclipse for products and customers. This system allows users to pefrorm CRUD queries on a databse.
The system consist of Databse configuration, main menu, products & customer query choice menu, CRUD queries & create-read-update-delete interfaces for CRUD queries. 

I have also peformed unit testing on the programming in order to achieve 60% test coverage.
The classes which have been tested include CRUDqueries, Product & Customer.
